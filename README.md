# FeedMyFlash

Have you ever wanted that the Internet feeds your pet rather then you do everyday? I did. 
So one fine day, I made a setup in which a rat getting feed by the Tweets from people who want to feed them, and they all can see the rat live on youtube. 

Later I've open sourced the project in order to share it with community. If you make something by using this. Tweet me @neelkadia I would love to see what you build.
